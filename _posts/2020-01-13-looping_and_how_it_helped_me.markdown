Looping is such a great tool to solve alot of problems in the simplest of ways. It can be used to iterate over objects so that you can search for specific elements. It can keep track of repeated steps till you reach a certain point. it can change elements in a specified area over a collection of data. looping or iterating is super versitile and im still using it since my first week of school. most recently i used it to parse through a list of data that i would need to break apart and assign to seprate elements. looping allows you to set parameters so that each piece of data in the collection is being seperated at the same point and that each variable is being set to the corrct piece of that split data.
