Ive always had a passion for building, structure, and problem solving. This led me to study Architecture while in school. But as time progressed and I became more reliant and addicted to my computor that I never wanted to leave it. I wanted to switch to a career path that would still let me use my passion but also keep me using the tech i had grown acustom to using. I looked into coding and saw that it was so free range. multiple solutions to the same problem. A large range of platforms to code each with its own pros and cons. Seeing the possibilties of what I could potentiallty be a part of ignited a spark within me. This is what I wanted to pursue. I wanted to create programs, apps, games. These are the things I use everyday and imaginging that I could be part of the team that was behind that was inspiring. These goals i had set in mind is what lead me down this road to start studying Software Engineering.
