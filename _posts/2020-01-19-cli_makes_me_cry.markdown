Well I guess its the end but in fact its only just begun. Tackling my first ever project starting from nothing but an idea is crazy. Did I finish the project, I guess. Did I accomplish what I had I planned, no. This project called on methods ands logic that i had learn nearly a month ago and still i had struggled. Thinking that this would be something i could pump out in a day or 2 took the whole week. A vast majority spent looking at broken code and errors. The other majority spent staring at code and thinking about what the next step would be. If there was one think I learned from this is that planning is crucial. Knowing what steps to take is the most important thing especially when you start from nothing. Getting the bare bones structure of my code working was encouraging. Thinking that I actually built something that actually has a purpose really put the point I had reached in my coding journy into perspective. That moment of "WOW this is actually working" was probably the best feeling for me. I cant wait to build more projects like this in the future, but I can say that this first one would be the one i never forget. I hope to build and improve it even more.
