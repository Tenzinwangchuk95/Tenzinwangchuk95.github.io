  When surfing the web and the pages of your favorite sites you start to think about how they know when you click things, submit forms, and even when hovering over certain elements. This is all thanks to Javascript. The amount of flexability you are allowed in Javascript is nothing short of magic. Event listeners make this magic possible. Targeting events such as hovers, scrolls, and ofcourse clicks is the first part of listeners. The next part allows the flexablilty when it comes to creating these effects. The function is up to the situation but wether be submiting a form, opening a window, or anything else. But what happens when events dont load in the order you want. Thats when asynchronus functions come in handy. Basicly creating a toggle for when you want certain returns after a specific functions finish. Awaiting for a response and then reloading allows a fix for when event listeners are loading before the information is loaded on the screen. These were some of the key components when I was creating the front end for my Js project.
