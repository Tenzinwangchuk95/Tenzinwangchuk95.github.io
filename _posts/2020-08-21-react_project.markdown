During this final project I used everything I have learned so far. Incorperating frame works and languages that ive learned to build a multi page application with a single backend API. This was a crowning achivement for me. It had reminded me of a time long ago when i had first surfed the web and pages were simple and tacky with minimal style. My project was simple but has promise to grow. React and Redux make it easy to add more to an application while keepin it DRY as possivle. Functional and Class components make it easy to divide conserns and translate well for easy readability and reusability. Writing HTML within a js file seems strange but JSX makes it possible. They are different yet similar. JSX syntax allows react translate it to HTML and basically allow us to render html right in the components. This way of rendering creates modular code that can be easy to change and reuse.
