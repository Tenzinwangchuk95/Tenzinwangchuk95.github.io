I think after getting over the hurdle of the CLI project, this seemed like a cake walk. But building this app really helped me to think about the bigger picture. How the MVC relationship worked felt so good to understand and execute on my own. I had finished my project before i ever knew it and i just wanted to keep going. Refining the views and controllers was tedious but seeing the changes effect the output in my localhost was such a great feeling. When you have this instant feedback it makes the changes you make ever so satisifying. This project was definitly a fun one and i hope there are more like it
