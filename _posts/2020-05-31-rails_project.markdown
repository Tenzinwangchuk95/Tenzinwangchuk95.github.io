My Rails project was a recipe tracker. It allowed for users to create accounts that would let them save recipes to share with other people. Users can view their own recipes to modify but can also view other recipes and leave reviews for other users to see. Users have many recipes that have many ratings. Tags can also be added to recipes. My app can also be signed in with facebook. the omniAuth was a bit tricky to get but is a great tool that can add user authentication in such a small line of code. The same thing took way more lines of code in the previous project. Shortcuts like this makes rails methods seem like magic.
